# Borophene	





## Borophene phases



$\chi_3$ and $\beta_12$ structures of boropphene



Thsese structural has metalic character and nonmagnetic



### $\chi_3$ vs $\beta_12$ 

#### 

- which one has more metalic character? why?
- Atom types for B12 (B6c, B5c, B4c)  and for X3 (B5c and B4c)
- Projected DOS shows that lower coordinated atoms has more contribution in structure conductance and less tendency to bind other atom (compare dos projected over different types)

#### B12

In the case of B12 we have B1|B2|B3 atoms as is shown in
