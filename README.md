# Borophene	





## Borophene phases



$\chi_3$ and $\beta_12$ structures of boropphene



Thsese structural has metalic character and nonmagnetic



### $\chi_3$ vs $\beta_12$ 

- which one has more metalic character? why?
- Atom types for B12 (B6c, B5c, B4c)  and for X3 (B5c and B4c)
- Projected DOS shows that lower coordinated atoms has more contribution in structure conductance and less tendency to bind other atom (compare dos projected over different types)
- 



## Transition metal adatom on 2D borophene



Adsorption of adatoms and gases can affect their properties drastically

Fe/X3   =====    average bonding length 1.93
